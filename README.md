# RegistrationPage
This is registration page. I made it using ASP.NET and CSS. 
If you want to clone this project to the visual studio, 
you need to update DOM. After cloning project to the folder, 
open it with visual studio and in the solution explorer right click
on the solution and go to Manage NuGet Packages and click tab-update,
select the whole project and click update. After that it's updated,
and you can use this project.
